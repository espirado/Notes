# Conda and Bioconda tutorial

This tutorial will get you up and running with Conda and Bioconda.

For an introductory set of slides on Conda and Bioconda see [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQ8gPzQ8bv5pJJtPAd3e0fe4pt2grnVwtGuoJBcao6RaS-IpiNLnV0nanQAYNGKpPs3wn4iKoIKSsck/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000)

### Today we are going to:

1. Install Conda via the Miniconda distribution
2. Learn about activation of the base conda environment
3. Configure Conda with Software "Channels"
4. Learn how to:
    * install tools using conda
    * remove tools
    * upgrade tools
5. How to handle version conflicts!
    * Conda environments
6. How to use conda environments
    * Create an environment
    * Add tools to an environment
    * Activate different environments

## 1. Install Conda *via* the Miniconda distribution.

First thing we have to do is download the installer from the Miniconda documentation website.

SSH Login to your Linux server

Then from your HOME directory:

```
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

Now we can install it, we will use the `-b` and `-s` switches for *silent mode* and *no post install scripts* respectively.

```

sh Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -s

```

We can watch it install and show the following:

```

## 2. Configure Conda with software "Channels"

Now we want to configure Conda with some extra software channels. We especially want to tell Conda where it can find all those awesome Bioinformatics tools we really want to use are.

So we need to add three "Channels" to conda's configurtation. They are:

* defaults - base packages for Conda
* bioconda - >8000 Bioinformatics tools and growing daily
* conda-forge - has most of the dependencies for all our favourite tools

We add the channels with the `conda config` command. The order in which we add the channels is very important. It will determine the order in which conda will search them for the appropriate packages. It's strange but the last one we add will have the highest priority. We want `conda-forge` to have the highest priority so we add it last...

```
conda config --add channels defaults
conda config --add channels bioconda
conda config --add channels conda-forge
```

Ok, so now we are all set!
